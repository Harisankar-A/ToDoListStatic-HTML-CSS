# Todo List

This repository contains an HTML document that displays a simple To-Do list with checkboxes. The design incorporates a color scheme and structure that visually represents tasks and their completion status.

## Features

- **Tasks with Checkboxes**: The list allows the user to mark tasks as completed by checking the boxes next to each item.
- **Strikethrough for Completed Tasks**: Completed tasks are marked with a strikethrough (`<del>` tag) to visually indicate that they are finished.
- **Colorful Design**: The to-do list is styled with custom colors and background shades for a clean and attractive interface.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:
- **To-Do List Items**: Each task in the list is represented by a checkbox and a label, with the option to strike through completed tasks.
- **Legend**: The title "Todo List" is placed within a legend tag inside the fieldset for better organization.

### CSS Styling:
- **Container Design**: The main container has a dark blue background (`#003049`) and centers the to-do list within a flexbox.
- **Fieldset Styling**: The fieldset has a red background (`#f14b4b`) to highlight the to-do list area, and the text is styled in a complementary color (`#003049`).
- **Checkbox Accent Color**: The checkboxes are styled with a black accent color for better visibility.
- **Strikethrough Effect**: The `<del>` tag is used to apply a strikethrough to completed tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the to-do list, including input fields for checkboxes and labels.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for background colors, font styles, and layout.

## Limitations

- **Static List**: The list is static, meaning it does not store or update the state of completed tasks when the page is reloaded.
- **No Backend Functionality**: There is no backend to save or manage tasks across sessions.
